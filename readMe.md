# The Shoppies

Hello! Thank you for checking out my version of The Shoppies. It is hosted at: https://blissful-archimedes-2350b3.netlify.app/.

In this project you will find three files: index.html, index.js, and main.css.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a single webpage application hosted through Netlify which can search for and return a list of OMDB films through OMDB's API. The list of films contains the title followed by the year it is made. The search results appears under the Results section the left of the webpage.

The user is given the option to nominate 5 films of their choice. The nominees are stored in the Nominations section to the right of the webpage. They cannot add the same film twice and so the button is disabled. They have the option to remove a nominee, if they choose to change their selection. Once 5 nominees are reached, the user is notified.

If you have any questions regarding the app, feel free to reach out to me via ds18nb@brocku.ca or at shah.dhrumil@outlook.com.

Have a wonderful day!
